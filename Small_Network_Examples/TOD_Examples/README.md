# Time of Day Examples

There are two small examples in this folder where the properties of the network are greatly affected by time of day.

## [Connecticut Ave, Washington DC](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS/blob/master/Small_Network_Examples/TOD_Examples/CT_Ave.md)

In this example, to accommodate peak hour flows, lanes reverse direction and parking lanes are temporarily used as travel lanes. 

It makes use of the following tables: 
  - node
  - link
  - lane
  - link_tod
  - lane_tod

## [I-93, North of Boston](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS/blob/master/Small_Network_Examples/TOD_Examples/I-93.md)

In this example, a segment of the highway has a shoulder that is used for travel during peak hours.

It makes use of the following tables: 
  - node
  - link
  - lane
  - segment
  - segment_tod
  - segment_lane_tod
