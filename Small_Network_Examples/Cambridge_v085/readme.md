# Broadway at Ames Street, Cambridge, MA

This example shows the proposed GMNS v0.85 specification around one
intersection in Cambridge, MA, near the Volpe Center.

It includes several intermodal features:

  - An east-west road (Broadway) with marked bike lanes and sidewalks. The sidewalks are their own links, while the bikelanes are an attribute of the road.  

  - A bike path and a separate pedestrian path approaching from the north

  - A road (Ames Street) with two-way cycletrack and sidewalks approaching from the south. 

The QGZ file in this folder can be used for visualizing the network; you
may need to change the filepaths to where GitHub is located on your
machine.

The nodes and links are shown below.  Red links are roads, green links are sidewalks and other pedestrian pathways, blue links are bicycle facilities.
